# Readings & Resources {#resources}

This page is a collection of books, papers, presentations, podcasts, and links to other resources that trainees have compiled. They span a variety of topics, some more relevant than others. They are also for various audiences, some explicitly academic/scholarly and others written for a broad public audience. We collect foundational citations, current and interesting research, work from diverse researchers, and conversations around current events that relate to our discussions, training, and/or research. 
Although we have collected these resources for our own use, we hope this page will be useful to others, and we encourage revisions and updates to this document.
