Outside of the activities within the department we describe elsewhere, we have participated in and led activities outside the department. Some of them are listed here.


## AMIA 2024 Podium Talk {#amia2024}

[Adrienne Pichon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriennepichon/) and [Chris Allsman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-allsman/) gave a talk at [AMIA 2024](https://www.amia.org/education-events/amia-2024-annual-symposium) titled "A Broad Perspective on Justice-Oriented Research in Biomedical Informatics". This page reiterates some main points and provides links to references and further reading.

### Overview and Activities of the Justice Informatics Collaborative

See other pages on this website for a [history of our group](#about) and a [list of books we have read](#resources) as part of our efforts. We also highlighted some activities not yet described on this site, including our role as reviewers for [the AMIA Inclusive Language and Context Style Guidelines](https://amia.org/about-amia/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/amia-inclusive-language-and-context-style-guidelines), a workshop we held at AMIA 2022, and subsequent work (in review) synthesizing principles for pursuing justice-oriented research.

We additionally summarized the [core values of our group](#mission-goals) as "humility + bravery + community".

### Significance of Trainee-led, Bottom-Up Work

We suggested that the model demonstrated by our group has unique strengths in promoting justice within biomedical informatics. In particular, it supports: 1) foregrounding trainee expertise and  autonomy, 2) working across disciplines and institutions, and 3) aligning academic work with trainee goals and values.

The final point was described in the context of the theory of goal congruity. [@DIEKMAN2020189; @Diekman2010] give an overview of goal congruity, and [@Gautam2024-to; @Lewis2019-cm; @Griffin2020-ud] discuss how a lack of congruity harms diversity and retention. Similarly, [@Clegg2024-lv] discusses the role of community and [@washington-2020] discusses the need for cultural competency.

### Fostering an Environment for Justice-Oriented Work

***For institutions***: See [@Marrero2013-mn; @marganalia-tenure] for a discussion of equitable practices for awarding tenure or allocating institutional resources. [@statnewsHealthEquity; @ezell-2024; @hci-tensions-2021] describes how health equity research may be co-opted to further institutional or researcher goals without materially supporting the needs of individuals and communities under study.

***For educators and mentors***: [@cultural-humility] describes the concept of cultural humility and [@Murray2022-zy] discusses how to apply it in academic mentoring. There is a large body of literature on developing culturally responsive, justice-oriented curricula in biomedical and computing disciplines, including [@Yadav2022-vn; @Vakil2018-ix; @Ambrose2014-ah; @lin-education-2022].

***For researchers and trainees***: See [here](#resources) for a long list of resources. A few other articles that point to frameworks to incorporate in your research or gaps in how researchers often conceptualize justice in biomedical informatics:
