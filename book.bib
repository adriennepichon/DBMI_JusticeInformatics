Two steps are fundamental: First, the social structure shapes a group's internalized psychology and externalized opportunities, and second, individuals navigate the social structure through their actions. Put simply, individuals seek to enter available roles that they anticipate will serve their goals. Opportunities to pursue goals, or affordances, thus structure individuals' initial decisions to enter or avoid the role, as well as the way in which they engage with the role. We review accumulating evidence that affordances influence role decisions—whether these affordances vary in terms of naturalistic variation, experimental manipulation, or intervention efforts. We examine sources and cues to affordances, as well as moderation by gender and other group differences. Finally, we articulate new research questions emerging from considering actual and perceived affordances of social roles.}

abstract = {The commonly documented diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) issues in the computing workforce are the direct result of corporate cultures that benefit specific groups and marginalize others. This culture usually begins in undergraduate computing departments, where the demographic representation mirrors that of industry. With no formal courses that focus on the non-technical issues affecting marginalized groups and how to address and eradicate them, students are indirectly taught that the current status quo in computing departments and industry is not only acceptable, but also unproblematic. This directly affects students from marginalized groups (as the reasons for attrition are similar in both higher education and industry), as well as faculty (as biased student evaluations directly affect hiring, promotion, and tenure decisions). This position paper presents the need for cultural competence as a required focus for university computing departments nationwide. By improving these issues before students complete baccalaureate computing degrees, companies will have talent pools that better understand the importance and necessity of DEI and also work to ensure they help foster a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment. In addition, more students from marginalized groups will be retained in the major through degree completion.},

abstract = {Research focused on health disparities—whether relating to one's race/ethnicity, gender expression, sexual orientation, citizenship status, income level, etc.—constitutes a large, generative, and highly profitable portion of scholarship in academic, clinical, and government settings. Health disparities research is expressed as a means of bringing greater attention to, and ultimately addressing via evidence-based implementation science, acts of devaluation and oppression that have continually contributed to these inequities. Philosophies underlying health disparities research's expansive and growing presence mirror the formal logic and ethos of the Military Industrial Complex and the Prison Industrial Complex. The “Health Disparities Research Industrial Complex,” operationalized in this article, represents a novel mutation and extension of these complexes, primarily being enacted through these three mechanisms: 1) The construction and maintenance of beliefs, behaviors, and policies in healthcare, and society more broadly, that create and sustain disadvantages in minority health; 2) the creation and funding of research positions that inordinately provide non-minoritized people and those without relevant lived experiences the ability to study health disparities as “health equity tourists”; and 3) the production of health disparities research that, due to factors one and two, is incapable of fully addressing the disparities. In this piece, these and other core elements of the Health Disparities Research Industrial Complex, and the research bubble that it has produced, are discussed. Additionally, strategies for reducing the footprint and impact of the Health Disparities Research Industrial Complex and better facilitating opportunities for meaningful implementation in the field are presented.}

We sought to understand how HCI researchers navigate work that engages with marginalized people and considerations researchers might work through to expand benefits and mitigate potential harms. In total, 24 HCI researchers, located primarily in the United States, participated in an interview, survey, or both. Through a reflexive thematic analysis, we identified four tensions—exploitation, membership, disclosure, and allyship. We explore the complexity involved in each, demonstrating that an equitable endpoint may not be possible, but this work is still worth pursuing when researchers make certain considerations. We emphasize that researchers who work with marginalized people should account for each tension in their research approaches to move forward. Finally, we propose an allyship-oriented approach to research that draws inspiration from discourse occurring in tangential fields and activist spaces and pushes the field into a new paradigm of research with marginalized people.},

abstract = {Justice-centered approaches to equitable computer science (CS) education frame CS learning as a means for advancing peace, antiracism, and social justice rather than war, empire, and corporations. However, most research in justice-centered approaches in CS education focus on K-12 learning environments. In this position paper, we review justice-centered approaches to CS education, problematize the lack of justice-centered approaches to CS in higher education in particular, and describe a justice-centered approach for undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms. Our approach emphasizes three components: (1) ethics: critiques the sociopolitical values of data structure and algorithm design as well as the underlying logics of dominant computing culture; (2) identity: draws on culturally responsive-sustaining pedagogies to emphasize student identity as rooted in resistance to the dominant computing culture; and (3) political vision: ensures the rightful presence of political struggles by reauthoring rights to frame CS learning as a force for social justice. Through a case study of this Critical Comparative Data Structures and Algorithms pedagogy, we argue that justice-centered approaches to higher CS education can help all computing students not only learn about the ethical implications of nominally technical concepts, but also develop greater respect for diverse epistemologies, cultures, and experiences surrounding computing that are essential to creating the socially-just worlds we need.},

@ARTICLE{Vakil2018-ix,
  title     = "Ethics, identity, and political vision: Toward a
               justice-centered approach to equity in computer science
               education",
  author    = "Vakil, Sepehr",
  abstract  = "In this essay, Sepehr Vakil argues that a more serious
               engagement with critical traditions in education research is
               necessary to achieve a justice-centered approach to equity in
               computer science (CS) education. With CS rapidly emerging as a
               distinct feature of K--12 public education in the United States,
               calls to expand CS education are often linked to equity and
               diversity concerns around expanding access to girls and
               historically underrepresented students of color. Yet, unlike
               other critical traditions in education research, equity-oriented
               CS research has largely failed to interrogate the sociopolitical
               context of CS education. To move toward a justice-centered
               approach to equity, Vakil argues, we must simultaneously attend
               to at least three features of CS education: the content of
               curriculum, the design of learning environments, and the
               politics and purposes of CS education reform. While there are
               many avenues of critical inquiry within and across each of these
               topics, the focus in this essay is on the role of ethics in the
               curriculum, the role of identity in CS learning environments,
               and the significance of a clear political vision for CS

abstract = {Many approaches in biomedical informatics (BMI) rely on the ability to define, gather, and manipulate biomedical data to support health through a cyclical research-practice lifecycle. Researchers within this field are often fortunate to work closely with healthcare and public health systems to influence data generation and capture and have access to a vast amount of biomedical data. Many informaticists also have the expertise to engage with stakeholders, develop new methods and applications, and influence policy. However, research and policy that explicitly seeks to address the systemic drivers of health would more effectively support health. Intersectionality is a theoretical framework that can facilitate such research. It holds that individual human experiences reflect larger socio-structural level systems of privilege and oppression, and cannot be truly understood if these systems are examined in isolation. Intersectionality explicitly accounts for the interrelated nature of systems of privilege and oppression, providing a lens through which to examine and challenge inequities. In this paper, we propose intersectionality as an intervention into how we conduct BMI research. We begin by discussing intersectionality’s history and core principles as they apply to BMI. We then elaborate on the potential for intersectionality to stimulate BMI research. Specifically, we posit that our efforts in BMI to improve health should address intersectionality’s five key considerations: (1) systems of privilege and oppression that shape health; (2) the interrelated nature of upstream health drivers; (3) the nuances of health outcomes within groups; (4) the problematic and power-laden nature of categories that we assign to people in research and in society; and (5) research to inform and support social change.}
