# About Our Group {#about}

## History
The Justice Informatics Student Group was started by a group of PhD students at Columbia University's Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) following the discussions in Summer 2020 about addressing racism in academia. Starting small, the group has organically grown by word of mouth among interested trainees. 



## Mission & Goals
The Justice Informatics group was created as a space to explore the systems of oppression, exclusion, and privilege that play out in our lives as individuals, scientists, and academics. The goal of this group is to provide a space to understand the sociopolitical and historical context of our research and engage in conversations we might not otherwise make space to discuss. Our group expands traditionally academic discussions, affirming that there is power in building and acknowledging personal connections to the stories and experiences of others. We seek to apply these principles to our work in informatics.

## Group Structure
Generally, the group selects one book to read each semester (Fall, Spring, Summer) that focuses on justice and technology, data, or research. Students meet weekly to discuss chapters and connect the readings to our own work in informatics and health, with a particular focus on feminist and anti-racist approaches. Faculty will be invited for a broad discussion of the book near the end of each semester.

In addition to discussing chapters from our selected books, we also share and discuss journal articles, podcasts or online lectures, relevant current events and twitter threads, and other related content. Finally, we use this group as a space to discuss racist or hate-driven events and otherwise cultivate a supportive space for students.
