[["index.html", "Justice Informatics Group Chapter 1 Overview", " Justice Informatics Group Columbia University DBMI Students 2024-11-07 Chapter 1 Overview The Justice Informatics Group was started by a group of PhD students at Columbia University’s Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) following the discussions in Summer 2020 about addressing racism in academia. Details of the group’s history, mission, and structure can be found in Chapter 2. Generally, the group selects one book to read each semester (Fall, Spring, Summer) that focuses on justice and technology, data, or research. Students meet weekly to discuss chapters and connect the readings to our own work in informatics and health, with a particular focus on feminist and anti-racist approaches. Faculty will be invited for a broad discussion of the book near the end of each semester. In addition to discussing chapters from our selected books, we also share and discuss journal articles, podcasts or online lectures, relevant current events and twitter threads, and other related content. Finally, we use this group as a space to discuss racist or hate-driven events and otherwise cultivate a supportive space for students. This work is essential for student development, to become leaders at our institutions and in our fields with an aim to understand and dismantle systemic injustices. Instructions for contributing to this resource can be found in Chapter 3.

In particular, the tragic and unjust killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Daniel Prude, to name a few, and the response by Black Lives Matter spurred many trainees to reflect on what we could do to address racism in our own lives. Starting small, the group has organically grown by word of mouth among interested trainees. From the begining the group created a space for trainees to discuss their own personal experiences with different forms of discrimination throughout our time in academia. From there we began to discuss how discrimination, particularly racism, impacts our own research from relying on various forms of academic literature to guide our discussions. We continue to hold space for students to share their stories and listen to the stories of others. 2.2 Mission &amp; Goals The Justice Informatics group was created as a space to explore the systems of oppression, exclusion, and privilege that play out in our lives as individuals, scientists, and academics. The goal of this group is to provide a space to understand the sociopolitical and historical context of our research and engage in conversations we might not otherwise make space to discuss. Our group expands traditionally academic discussions, affirming that there is power in building and acknowledging personal connections to the stories and experiences of others. We seek to apply these principles to our work in informatics. The goals of this group are outlined below. Create a space for DBMI trainees to explore the sociopolitical and historical context of our research and engage in conversations we might not otherwise make space to discuss. Allow for students to share, listen, and discuss their personal stories about being from marginalized communities while navigating academia. Leave a legacy by creating notes and summaries of resources for future trainees and others to engage with. Provide resources to facilitate anti-racist work within DBMI through suggestions for scholars to engage with and cite and resources to help us reflexively examine our ideas on how science is conducted. Facilitate a student-led, discussion-based lesson to share key insights and themes from resources with the faculty and trainees. These are not expected to replace engagement with the resources, but rather to promote synthesis and growth of main themes with work in our department. 2.3 Group Structure Generally, the group selects one book to read each semester (Fall, Spring, Summer) that focuses on justice and technology, data, or research. Students meet weekly to discuss chapters and connect the readings to our own work in informatics and health, with a particular focus on feminist and anti-racist approaches. Faculty will be invited for a broad discussion of the book near the end of each semester. In addition to discussing chapters from our selected books, we also share and discuss journal articles, podcasts or online lectures, relevant current events and twitter threads, and other related content. Finally, we use this group as a space to discuss racist or hate-driven events and otherwise cultivate a supportive space for students.

Some of them are listed here. 7.1 AMIA 2024 Podium Talk Adrienne Pichon and Chris Allsman gave a talk at AMIA 2024 titled “A Broad Perspective on Justice-Oriented Research in Biomedical Informatics”. This page reiterates some main points and provides links to references and further reading. 7.1.1 Overview and Activities of the Justice Informatics Collaborative See other pages on this website for a history of our group and a list of books we have read as part of our efforts. We also highlighted some activities not yet described on this site, including our role as reviewers for the AMIA Inclusive Language and Context Style Guidelines, a workshop we held at AMIA 2022, and subsequent work (in review) synthesizing principles for pursuing justice-oriented research. We additionally summarized the core values of our group as “humility + bravery + community”. 7.1.2 Significance of Trainee-led, Bottom-Up Work We suggested that the model demonstrated by our group has unique strengths in promoting justice within biomedical informatics. In particular, it supports: 1) foregrounding trainee expertise and autonomy, 2) working across disciplines and institutions, and 3) aligning academic work with trainee goals and values. The final point was described in the context of the theory of goal congruity. (Amanda B. Diekman, Joshi, and Benson-Greenwald 2020; Amanda B. Diekman et al. 2010) give an overview of goal congruity, and (Gautam et al. 2024; Lewis et al. 2019; Griffin 2020) discuss how a lack of congruity harms diversity and retention. Similarly, (Clegg 2024) discusses the role of community and (A. N. Washington 2020) discusses the need for cultural competency. 7.1.3 Fostering an Environment for Justice-Oriented Work For institutions: See (Marrero et al. 2013; Baker 2015) for a discussion of equitable practices for awarding tenure or allocating institutional resources. (McFarling 2021; Ezell 2024; Calvin A. Liang, Munson, and Kientz 2021a) describes how health equity research may be co-opted to further institutional or researcher goals without materially supporting the needs of individuals and communities under study. For educators and mentors: (Chávez 2012) describes the concept of cultural humility and (Murray, Hinton, and Spencer 2022) discusses how to apply it in academic mentoring. There is a large body of literature on developing culturally responsive, justice-oriented curricula in biomedical and computing disciplines, including (Yadav, Heath, and Hu 2022; Vakil 2018; Ambrose et al. 2014; Lin 2022).
