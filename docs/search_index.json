Details of the group’s history, mission, and structure can be found in Chapter 2. Generally, the group selects one book to read each semester (Fall, Spring, Summer) that focuses on justice and technology, data, or research. Students meet weekly to discuss chapters and connect the readings to our own work in informatics and health, with a particular focus on feminist and anti-racist approaches. Faculty will be invited for a broad discussion of the book near the end of each semester. In addition to discussing chapters from our selected books, we also share and discuss journal articles, podcasts or online lectures, relevant current events and twitter threads, and other related content. Finally, we use this group as a space to discuss racist or hate-driven events and otherwise cultivate a supportive space for students. This work is essential for student development, to become leaders at our institutions and in our fields with an aim to understand and dismantle systemic injustices. Instructions for contributing to this resource can be found in Chapter 3.

In particular, the tragic and unjust killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Daniel Prude, to name a few, and the response by Black Lives Matter spurred many trainees to reflect on what we could do to address racism in our own lives. Starting small, the group has organically grown by word of mouth among interested trainees. From the begining the group created a space for trainees to discuss their own personal experiences with different forms of discrimination throughout our time in academia. From there we began to discuss how discrimination, particularly racism, impacts our own research from relying on various forms of academic literature to guide our discussions. We continue to hold space for students to share their stories and listen to the stories of others. 2.2 Mission &amp; Goals The Justice Informatics group was created as a space to explore the systems of oppression, exclusion, and privilege that play out in our lives as individuals, scientists, and academics. The goal of this group is to provide a space to understand the sociopolitical and historical context of our research and engage in conversations we might not otherwise make space to discuss. Our group expands traditionally academic discussions, affirming that there is power in building and acknowledging personal connections to the stories and experiences of others. We seek to apply these principles to our work in informatics. The goals of this group are outlined below. Create a space for DBMI trainees to explore the sociopolitical and historical context of our research and engage in conversations we might not otherwise make space to discuss. Allow for students to share, listen, and discuss their personal stories about being from marginalized communities while navigating academia. Leave a legacy by creating notes and summaries of resources for future trainees and others to engage with. Provide resources to facilitate anti-racist work within DBMI through suggestions for scholars to engage with and cite and resources to help us reflexively examine our ideas on how science is conducted. Facilitate a student-led, discussion-based lesson to share key insights and themes from resources with the faculty and trainees. These are not expected to replace engagement with the resources, but rather to promote synthesis and growth of main themes with work in our department. 2.3 Group Structure Generally, the group selects one book to read each semester (Fall, Spring, Summer) that focuses on justice and technology, data, or research. Students meet weekly to discuss chapters and connect the readings to our own work in informatics and health, with a particular focus on feminist and anti-racist approaches. Faculty will be invited for a broad discussion of the book near the end of each semester. In addition to discussing chapters from our selected books, we also share and discuss journal articles, podcasts or online lectures, relevant current events and twitter threads, and other related content.

Please follow the following instructions: Fork the repository to make a copy within your Github profile. The fork button is at the top right corner of this webpage. Where to fork the repository Forked repository Clone and make any revisions/contributions you may like. Where to clone the repository Cloning the repository from the terminal Knitted local copy of website via RStudio Stage and commit your revisions/additions to your forked repository. Make a pull request by clicking ‘make a pull request’ under the contributing button at your repository online, comment on what your pull request is and why it adds to this website, and wait for an administrator to review and possibly accept your pull request. (Note, in the future we will push to a draft branch; but until we have a ‘live’ version of the site, we will only use the main branch.) For the website to be updated with new changes, the bookdown must be ‘built’ locally using R, and then the docs folder must be committed and pushed to the main branch. 3.2 Formatting for contributions 3.2.1 New Pages For contributing a new page: Rmd file but without header content; starts with main heading with a hash, eg “# Heading Text” Name the file so that it compiles in order (files compile alphanumerically) 3.2.2 Adding Citations Add the reference to the book.bib file in BibLaTex format (can be set as export format in Zotero, then dragged to text file). Remove extra info (eg, abstract, url dates) so that the bib file stays clean and the reference prints neatly. Try to include a url so that people can jump to the resource on their own. Using the name assigned in the bib file, add a citation in the text using @name in square brackets, eg, [@washington_medical_2008] 3.2.3 Getting Started with GitHub Here are some resources for getting started with using GitHub, and contributing to this repository: Git book Fork a repo Data school youtube video - fork a repo 3.3 Contributors These students have created and maintain this website resource: Nick Giangreco "],["meetings.html", "Chapter 4 Meetings 4.1 Summer 2021 Meeting Schedule", " Chapter 4 Meetings Meetings are: Fridays 10am ET.

They span a variety of topics, some more relevant than others. They are also for various audiences, some explicitly academic/scholarly and others written for a broad public audience. We collect foundational citations, current and interesting research, work from diverse researchers, and conversations around current events that relate to our discussions, training, and/or research. Although we have collected these resources for our own use, we hope this page will be useful to others, and we encourage revisions and updates to this document.
