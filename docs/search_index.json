[["index.html", "Justice Informatics Student Group Chapter 1 Overview", " Justice Informatics Student Group Columbia University DBMI Students 2021-07-30 Chapter 1 Overview The Justice Informatics Student Group was started by a group of PhD students at Columbia University’s Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) following the discussions in Summer 2020 about addressing racism in academia. Details of the group’s history, mission, and structure can be found in Chapter 2. Generally, the group selects one book to read each semester (Fall, Spring, Summer) that focuses on justice and technology, data, or research. Students meet weekly to discuss chapters and connect the readings to our own work in informatics and health, with a particular focus on feminist and anti-racist approaches. Faculty will be invited for a broad discussion of the book near the end of each semester. In addition to discussing chapters from our selected books, we also share and discuss journal articles, podcasts or online lectures, relevant current events and twitter threads, and other related content. Finally, we use this group as a space to discuss racist or hate-driven events and otherwise cultivate a supportive space for students. This work is essential for student development, to become leaders at our institutions and in our fields with an aim to understand and dismantle systemic injustices. Instructions for contributing to this resource can be found in Chapter 3.

Starting small, the group has organically grown by word of mouth among interested trainees. 2.2 Mission &amp; Goals The Justice Informatics group was created as a space to explore the systems of oppression, exclusion, and privilege that play out in our lives as individuals, scientists, and academics. The goal of this group is to provide a space to understand the sociopolitical and historical context of our research and engage in conversations we might not otherwise make space to discuss. Our group expands traditionally academic discussions, affirming that there is power in building and acknowledging personal connections to the stories and experiences of others. We seek to apply these principles to our work in informatics.

Please follow the following instructions: Fork the repository to make a copy within your Github profile. The fork button is at the top right corner of this webpage. Clone and make any revisions/contributions you may like. Stage and commit your revisions/additions to your forked repository. Make a pull request by clicking ‘make a pull request’ under the contributing button at your repository online, comment on what your pull request is and why it adds to this website, and wait for an administrator to review and possibly accept your pull request. (Note, in the future we will push to a draft branch; but until we have a ‘live’ version of the site, we will only use the main branch.) For the website to be updated with new changes, the bookdown must be ‘built’ locally using R, and then the docs folder must be committed and pushed to the main branch. 3.2 Formatting for contributions 3.2.1 New Pages For contributing a new page: rmd file but without header content; starts with main heading with a hash, eg “# Heading Text” name the file so that it compiles in order (files compile alphanumerically) 3.2.2 Adding Citations Add the reference to the book.bib file in BibLaTex format (can be set as export format in Zotero, then dragged to text file). Remove extra info (eg, abstract, url dates) so that the bib file stays clean and the reference prints neatly. Try to include a url so that people can jump to the resource on their own. Using the name assigned in the bib file, add a citation in the text using @name in square brackets, eg, [@washington_medical_2008] 3.2.3 Getting Started with GitHub Here are some resources for getting started with using GitHub, and contributing to this repository: (to be added) 3.3 Contributors These students have created and maintain this website resource: (to be added) "],["meetings.html", "Chapter 4 Meetings 4.1 Summer 2021 Meeting Schedule", " Chapter 4 Meetings Meetings are: Fridays 10am ET.
